# Python Reference Implementation

This directory contains the original Python implementation of fms-core, kept for reference and documentation purposes.

## Contents

- `setup.py` - Original Python package setup
- `fmsc/` - Original Python source code

## Purpose

These files are maintained as:
- **Reference documentation** - To understand the original implementation
- **Migration reference** - To compare Python vs TypeScript implementations
- **Historical record** - To preserve the original codebase

## Note

The active TypeScript implementation is in the `src/` directory. This Python code is **not actively maintained** and is kept purely for reference.
